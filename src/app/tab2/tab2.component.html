            Proact offering disinfection service to disinfect the premises
            thoroughly to minimize the risk of contamination. We will be
            introducing a new treatment procedure using ULV cold fogging by
            machine that uses large volumes of air at low pressures to transform
            liquid chemicals into droplets that are dispersed into the
            atmosphere. This procedure provides outstanding results with regard
            to efficacy and residual control on airborne insects and
            viruses.This chemical is completely odorless and safe as its LD 50
            value is very high (5000mg/kg) compare to DDVP (50mg/kg).
